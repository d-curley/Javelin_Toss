# Javelin_Toss
Using inverse kinematics and computer vision, this interactive is a game much like dodgeball, 
where two players stand in front of a camera and screen holding a physical colored ball in their hand to control their digital hand in the game. 
From there, the goal is to catch the javelins and throw them at your opponent!

For my scripts that run the game, see Assets/Scripts/Jav Dodgeball Scripts/
